# LimaDefender 🛡️🧟‍♂️

**LimaDefender** is a project developed as the final assignment for the **Algorithms** course, combining **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using C++ classes, and displaying the game interface via **Windows Forms**. The game revolves around the fight to protect an energy generator ⚡ that powers a protective dome 🏰, which in turn prevents a virus (represented by zombies 🧟‍♂️) from spreading in the city of Lima. The game aims to raise awareness about the importance of managing health emergencies and diseases, specifically during times of disasters.

The project is inspired by **Goal 8** of the **Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas 2018-2030**, focusing on protecting the most vulnerable populations from disease outbreaks, emergencies, and disasters.

## Installation and Running ⚙️🚀

1. **Prerequisites**:  
    - **Visual Studio 2022** installed.
    - **C++ and Windows Forms** enabled in the Visual Studio IDE.

2. **Installation Instructions**:
    - Clone this repository or download the source code.
    - Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
    - Ensure that the C++ compiler is correctly set up for a **Windows Forms** project.
    
3. **Running the Game**:
    - Once you open the project in Visual Studio, simply press **F5** to build and run the project. 🏃‍♂️
    - The game will run without showing an additional console, only the graphical interface. 🎮

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this game is to **raise awareness** in an entertaining way about the importance of managing outbreaks and the collaboration needed to protect populations during emergencies, such as natural disasters and disease outbreaks. The player must prevent zombies 🧟‍♂️ from destroying the generator ⚡ that powers the dome 🏰, which is essential to prevent the virus from spreading in the city.

### Key Features ✨:
- **Strategy and defense**: The player must protect the generator ⚡ while defending against zombies 🧟‍♂️.
- **Real-time gameplay**: The action unfolds in real-time with simple controls. 🕹️
- **Clear visualization**: The game state and progress are displayed on an intuitive graphical interface. 🖥️

## Development 💻

During the development process, various principles and techniques were applied, including:

- **Entity Management**: Using classes to create objects like the energy generator ⚡, the enemies 🧟‍♂️, the player character 🦸‍♂️, and the game mechanics.
- **Graphics and Events**: Managing game events within the Windows Forms interface, including graphic updates, moving object control, and interaction detection between the player character and zombies 🧟‍♂️.

## Contributions 🤝
